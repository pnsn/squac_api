Fixture data is used for dev, testing and staging evironments
For dev and staging use the bootstrap_db manager. In testing fixtures are 
referenced in test class
The following fixture files are created serpartely to allow for easier updating
auth.json (all auth models)
    ./mg.sh "dumpdata auth --indent=2 > fixtures/auth.json"
core_user.json
    ./mg.sh "dumpdata core_user --indent=2 > fixtures/core_user.json"
base.json 
    ./mg.sh 'dumpdata --exclude=core.user \
                      --exclude=auth.permission \
                      --exclude=measurement.measurement \
                      --exclude=contenttypes.contenttype \
                      --indent=2 > fixtures/base.json'

measurements.json
    This is used only in testing. For dev and staging, the bootstrap_db
    manager creates these dynamically

the bootstrap_db needs all fixtures in the same file to avoid race conditions
use the ./scripts/build_fixtures.py to compile to a single all.json file

and django_content_type:

Then open file and delete first line
Congratulations, you just fixtured


Note: changing model name does not remove the legacy permissions
1) delete  from auth_group_permissions where ...
2) delete  from auth_permission where codename like '%archive';
3) delete from django_content_type where model like '%archive';
