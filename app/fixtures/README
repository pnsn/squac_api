Fixture data is used for dev, testing and staging evironments
For dev and staging use the bootstrap_db manager. In testing fixtures are 
referenced in test class
To create fixtures from existing test data run:
./mg.sh "dumpdata  --indent=2 > fixtures/name_of_file.json"

to dump a single app

./mg.sh "dumpdata app_label --indent=2 > fixtures/fixtures_app_label.json"

to dump single model

./mg.sh "dumpdata app_label.model --indent=2 > fixtures/model.json"

the bootstrap_db needs all fixtures in a single file to avoid fk errors. 
and django_content_type:

Then open file and delete first line
Congratulations, you just fixtured


Note: changing model name does not remove the legacy permissions
1) delete  from auth_group_permissions where ...
2) delete  from auth_permission where codename like '%archive';
3) delete from django_content_type where model like '%archive';
